Instead of trying to directly access a native module, use the appropriate Expo API or a compatible library.  For example, if you're working with camera access, instead of using a native camera module, you should leverage Expo's `expo-camera` library.  This manages the underlying native interactions and provides a cross-platform API for your JavaScript code.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

// ... use Camera API ...
```
This approach ensures that your code remains compatible with the Expo managed workflow and avoids the errors associated with attempting to interact with native modules directly.
